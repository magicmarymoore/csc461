        QUESTION:
        Using Scala's fancy output options. Take the following variables
            val a = 3
            val b = 1.25
            val tag = "Result"
         and output the following string
            3/1.25 Result:   =                2.40%
         Where
            -Result (with the colon) has a left justification and width 10
            -2.4 is 3/1.25 formatted to 2 decimal places, right justified with width 20




        Answer:
            println(f"$a/$b ${tag+":"}%-10s=${a/b}%20.2f%%")
         */

        //more fancy output
        //the """ PLUS the | PLUS the stripMargin says align to |
        //There is more to it, but this is still quite handy!
        println(
            """
              |Menu with built in alignment!
